Fumbly Diddle Software announces our latest release: Timestamp Now.

Have you ever needed to set one or more timestamps (Created, Modified, and/or Accessed) on one or more Windows files and/or directories to the current date/time (timestamp)?  Well, Timestamp Now takes care of it for you. 

Simply right-click on a selection of files and directories in Windows File Explorer and select the **Timestamp Now** option. The application's main interface appears and prompts you to select the timestamps to modify and the format of that timestamp value written to the selected files and directories.

Read the [Product Page](/products/timestampnow/) or [Documentation](https://docs.fumblydiddle.com/timestampnow/){target="_blank"}, or {% downloadLink "TimestampNow" "Download the software" %}.
