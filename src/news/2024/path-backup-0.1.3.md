Fumbly Diddle Software released an updated version of our Path Backup & Restore application for Microsoft Windows today. This release fixes an issue where the application home screen didn't render correctly on some systems. 

**Note:** This version's installer changes the default target folder for the application; moving it from "c:\program files\Fumbly Diddle\" to "c:\program files\Fumbly Diddle Software\Path Backup\". Please uninstall the current version before installing today's release.
